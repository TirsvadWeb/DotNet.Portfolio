# Choose Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) for Client-Side Development and APIs

## Status
Accepted

## Changelog
- v1.0 (2026-02-02): Initial decision record created.

## 1. Blazor for Client-Side Development

### Context
To build interactive web applications using .NET technologies, we need a framework that allows for seamless integration with our existing .NET backend and provides a rich user experience.
### Decision
Adopt Blazor as the primary framework for client-side web development.

### Rationale
Blazor enables developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript, allowing for code sharing between client and server.
It integrates well with the .NET ecosystem, supports component-based architecture, and has strong tooling support in Visual Studio.

### Consequences
- All new client-side web applications will be developed using Blazor.
- Developers will need to familiarize themselves with Blazor concepts and best practices.
- The team will leverage Blazor's component model for building reusable UI components.

## 2. WebAssembly (WASM) for Client-Side Execution
### Context
WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format that allows code written in multiple languages to run on the web at near-native speed. 
It provides a way to execute code in the browser without relying on JavaScript.

### Decision
Adopt WebAssembly (WASM) as the primary technology for client-side execution in Blazor applications.

### Rationale
WASM enables high-performance execution of .NET code in the browser, allowing for a more responsive user experience.
It also opens up the possibility of using other languages alongside C# in the same application.

### Consequences
- Blazor applications will leverage WASM for client-side execution, improving performance and responsiveness.
- Developers may need to learn about WASM and its integration with Blazor.
